This was a project in which we had to create a program that would allow the user to enter a size for a chess board and then select a starting point and an end point. The program would then figure out the shortest path from the start to the goal using the movement pattern of a knight in chess (L shape). It then prints out the number of moves as well as the path that the knight would have to take in order to get from start to finish in the least amount of moves. I decided to use Dijkstra's algorithm for this project.
